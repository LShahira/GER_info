    <div class="topic-writting">
      <p style="padding-bottom:40px ;"><strong>Gazi M.A. Ehsan ur Rahman</strong> received B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 1999 and 2008, respectively. He earned Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, in December 2022. Recently Gazi finished leading an RND team of a Canadian Startup company to develop IoT solutions for various North American industries and has been there for eighteen months. During this period, he had firsthand experience working with the IoT cloud. He also led the technical team developing and providing automation solutions to various local industries in Bangladesh for six years. Prior to that, he had the opportunity to work as an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department of United International University (UIU), Dhaka, Bangladesh, for more than eight years. He led the Robotics team of UIU to the “University Rover Challenge” organized by The Mars Society in Utah, USA, in June 2017. During his early career, he worked for cellular service providers in Bangladesh for more than nine years, where he had hands-on experience with various telecommunication equipment and tools. His present research objectives include building the basis of a Wide-area Wireless Sensor Network (WWSN) and focusing future research on virtualization and security aspects in a cloud environment for real-time, resource-constrained devices and system-on-chips for Smart Agriculture and Health applications.</p>

        In a WWSN, sensor nodes are distributed over a wide area, and some applications, such as Smart Livestock monitoring, may have mobile sensor nodes. The proposed Lightweight Dynamic Clustering Algorithm (LDCA) based on the Lightweight Dynamic Auto Reconfigurable Protocol (LDAP) can cover a wider area of monitoring using the Long-Range (LoRa) technology. LDAP enables the mobile data sink to acquire the data from the nodes, and the LDCA performs real-time clustering, enhancing the network capacity. Further improvement is going on to improve WSN lifetime and coverage area. <br>

        Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However, unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the maximum benefit of AWD. The manual operation may introduce uncontrolled methane emissions impacting the environment. Automation of AWD is a combination of three different tasks, field water level monitoring, environmental monitoring and control and monitoring of the irrigation system. It becomes more complicated with the dimension and coverage area. This research proposed an IoT platform combining three different WSNs. It provides the mathematical models required for dimensioning of the AWD system implemented on the WWSN and IoT platforms.<br>
